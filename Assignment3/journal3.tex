\begin{enumerate}
    \item Relevance with current research aspects
    \item Logic in comparision
    \item Higher Magnitude in number of comparative entities

\end{enumerate}

\section{My Reasearch Idea}
I would like to research how a multiple fetching and decode
units inn processoor pipeline can either improve or eliminate
the brnach prediction in superscalar micro controllers. My goal for a paper
in this course is to gather information about contemporary branch prediction techiniques used in 
different processors and also get a quantification how noel this approach is so that I might pursue a Ph.D on this.

\section{Inner Child Voice}
\subsection{Theory: }
Imagine a man who just does everything you tell him to do one thing at a time. Now he sometimes has a problem in figuring out what to do next.
For example if you are teaching him how to make some chicken, and if you told him, "Put the chicken if the oven is preheated, otherwise wait for the oven", Sometimes the man guesses
the oven is preheated and puts the chicken in, if the oven isn't ready he will take out the chicken and wait. But putting in the chicken and taking it out again is a waste of time unless he already knows
that he can just wait. So he an assistant who would have the next step always ready for the man so that he wouldn't waste time with guessing and correcting.
