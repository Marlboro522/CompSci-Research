\section*{Current progress: }
I have trouble articulating my visualization. I am focusing more on reading.
I am also working on the draft and following the paper structure shown
in class. I am satisfied with the story of the paper and the structure. I am also working
on setting the abstract right and the literature review.
I have written drafts of various branch prediction techniques and how they
work. I am also working on evaluating the methods with the gem5 simulator.
\section*{How this course has helped me: }
As I am planning for a Ph.D, my work in this course has given me an extensive literature review.
If this paper is satisfactory to me by the end of the semester, I will
move on to publishing it in a journal. If not, I need to find a novel approach
to solving the problem of branch prediction and gain as much knowledge in the generic
domain of computer architecture as possible.
