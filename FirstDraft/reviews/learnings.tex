\begin{itemize}
    \item I was able too see my inadequacies in writing and presenting styles. 
    \item I was able to see the importance of being clear and concise in writing.
    \item Iw as able to see how articulation can change the way a sentence is heard. 
    \item I was able to see how much of the work goes into writing a survey paper.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{} I was also able to find the importance of being productive and punctual about meeting deadlines. Particularly, after seeing my reveiw
I had more insight into what I can do to improve the story line of the paper. 

It also made me realize how I devaited from the main story line in the chase of making the paper technnically more sound. I am sure I would be more conscious about this in future.
Overall it has been a great learning experience. I am confident that second draft will be alot better than my first draft in terms of story.
